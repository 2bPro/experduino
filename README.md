# Experduino

Experimenting with Arduino Uno and MEGA - LEDs, ultrasonic sensors, MusicShield and Touch Board on a Linux machine  

## Getting Started

Download the latest version of [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) and make sure it recognises the arduino board and port. Test it with a the beginners tutorial or demos.  

To create LED arrays, the [sparkfun](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/sik-experiment-guide-for-arduino---v32/experiment-4-driving-multiple-leds) tutorial is a good starting point.   

To use ultrasonic sensors to control LEDs, the [instructables](http://www.instructables.com/id/Simple-Arduino-and-HC-SR04-Example/) tutorial is a good starting point.  

If you have a Waveshare Music Shield board, the repository already contains the Music Shield library and details on how to use it can be found in the [Waveshare Music Shield User Manual](https://www.waveshare.com/w/upload/b/b2/Music-Shield-Manual.pdf).  

To use a Bare Conductive Touch Board, you must use the [Touch Board installer](https://www.bareconductive.com/make/setting-up-arduino-with-your-touch-board/).
